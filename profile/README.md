## About HashGrid Networks

HashGrid Networks is an enterprise Bitcoin mining infrastructure company focused on sustainable, autonomous mining operations powered by advanced liquid cooling, AI-driven optimization, and open-source technology leadership. We are dedicated to redefining Bitcoin mining around innovation, sustainability, and technical excellence while empowering miners from hobbyist scale to institutional fleets to operate profitably and independently.

### Mission Statement

HashGrid Networks and our core technology **TerraHash Stack** are pioneering sustainable, autonomous bitcoin mining operations that maximize efficiency, profitability, and environmental stewardship through innovative liquid cooling, AI-driven optimization, and decentralized finance integration.

We empower miners from enthusiasts to institutional operators to scale profitably while advancing the bitcoin ecosystem. As stewards of open-source mining technology and leading contributors to the global open-source mining development movement, we accelerate the democratization of mining and strengthen the resilience of the Bitcoin network through transparent, community-driven innovation.

### Core Principles

#### 1. Open Source Stewardship and Community Leadership
Make mining technology open and share it freely so everyone can benefit. We are committed practitioners of open-source development and recognized leaders within the global mining development community. We contribute significant engineering resources to foundational projects like BraiinsOS, actively participate in mining protocol discussions, mentor emerging developers, and share knowledge freely.

#### 2. Efficiency Through Innovation
Constantly improve mining technology and operations, sharing our innovations with the community to make mining more efficient and resilient for everyone. We obsessively pursue technical excellence in mining operations, continuously optimizing hardware performance, thermal management, and energy utilization.

#### 3. Autonomy and Decentralization
Give miners full control and freedom by using open tools that avoid lock-in and support independence from any single provider. We believe in empowering individuals and organizations to control their own mining destiny. Our platform leverages open-source firmware, non-custodial financial tools, and edge computing to minimize dependence on centralized intermediaries.

#### 4. Sustainability as Competitive Advantage
Use clean energy and resource recovery to make mining more profitable and sustainable for the long term. Bitcoin mining powered by renewable energy, waste heat recovery, and responsible thermal management is not merely ethical—it's economically superior.

#### 5. Proof of Work Economics
Real value in bitcoin mining comes from visible effort, investment, and productive work—not speculation. We honor the principle that valuable creation requires tangible effort—energy conversion, capital investment, engineering expertise, and operational discipline.

### About TerraHash Stack

The **TerraHash Stack** is a modular Bitcoin mining platform that integrates liquid-cooled hardware infrastructure, AI-driven operations management, and DeFi-aware treasury tooling to deliver highly efficient, autonomous mining facilities for both edge and enterprise environments.

At the software and AI layer, TerraHash Stack exposes mining control, pool telemetry, and network analytics via Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers so AI agents can monitor, optimize, and manage fleets, pools, and profitability using natural language workflows.

### Featured TerraHash Stack Components

These MCP servers are key building blocks of the TerraHash Stack platform and are developed and maintained by Ryno Crypto Mining Services:

#### [braiins-os-mcp-server](https://github.com/Ryno-Crypto-Mining-Services/braiins-os-mcp-server)
An MCP server that bridges AI assistants like Claude and Copilot to Braiins OS ASIC miner firmware, enabling secure gRPC-based monitoring, firmware management, fleet metrics, and operational control through standardized tools and REST APIs.

#### [braiins-pool-mcp-server](https://github.com/Ryno-Crypto-Mining-Services/braiins-pool-mcp-server)
An MCP server that integrates AI clients with the Braiins Pool API, providing worker monitoring, earnings analytics, pool statistics, payout configuration, and related workflows with TypeScript, OAuth-capable, cache-aware infrastructure.

#### [braiins-insights-mcp-server](https://github.com/Ryno-Crypto-Mining-Services/braiins-insights-mcp-server)
An MCP server that connects AI assistants to the Braiins Insights Dashboard API, delivering real-time network hashrate, difficulty, mining economics, historical series, and composite profitability and "network health" analyses through 17+ tools.

### Trademark Notice

**TerraHash Stack** is a registered trademark of HashGrid Networks and represents its flagship Bitcoin mining technology platform. The TerraHash Stack product line is sold and supported exclusively by **Ryno Crypto Mining Services, LLC**, which operates as the primary commercial delivery and support arm for TerraHash-powered mining deployments.
